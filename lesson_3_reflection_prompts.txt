1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 when multiple people are working on a repository from different locations.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
 
 You can make sure you don't pull a version which is currently under 
 development.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
 you use one instead of another?
 I understand the differences. I'll save time by not writing an explanation.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
 stored locally?
 You don't need internet connection to continue work when you a copy stored 
 locally. You can then merge your changes later.
 
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
  and what would be harder?
  Share code via some online platform like Dropbox.
