1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 when multiple people are working on a repository from different locations.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
 
 You can make sure you don't pull a version which is currently under 
 development.
